# L7 Data Promise

> **The ChefLife Commitment to Restaurant Operators**

---

## The Promise

**We learn from your data to make you smarter—not to lose your history.**

Your vendor invoices tell a story: seasonal price swings, vendor reliability, cost trends that affect your bottom line. Every data point matters. We treat your data with the respect it deserves.

## What L7 Means

L7 is our highest design standard—beyond pixels and UX. It's about **data integrity, user trust, and operational intelligence**.

| Level | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| L5 | Visual design, layout, hierarchy |
| L6 | Interaction patterns, workflows, efficiency |
| **L7** | **Data promise: learning, protection, intelligence** |

## The Three Pillars

### 1. We Never Lose Your History

**When vendors change their codes:**
- Your price trends stay continuous
- Historical data is archived, never deleted
- The audit trail shows what changed and when

**When you correct an invoice:**
- Previous versions are superseded, not erased
- Version history maintained for accounting
- Full traceability to source documents

### 2. We Learn to Serve You Better

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Common descriptions across vendors → Smarter matching suggestions
- Seasonal price patterns → Future alerts (coming)
- Code change patterns → Better auto-detection (coming)

**What We DON'T Do:**
- Never share your pricing data with vendors
- Never expose your costs to competitors
- Never train external models on your proprietary data

### 3. We Respect Your Time

**Every import should make you smarter:**
- Matched items update automatically
- Unmatched items queue for your review (Triage)
- System explains what happened and why

**We don't ask twice:**
- Set `common_name` once, umbrella links forever
- Approve a code change once, future invoices auto-match
- Configure once, benefit continuously

## How This Manifests in ChefLife

### Vendor Invoice Manager
- **Ghost items** (Triage) = honest about uncertainty
- **Version control** = corrections don't erase history
- **Audit trail** = every price traceable to source

### Umbrella Ingredients
- **Cross-vendor aggregation** = true cost picture
- **common_name linking** = your terminology, our intelligence
- **Pricing strategies** = your choice how to calculate

### Code Groups
- **Auto-detection** = we handle vendor admin noise
- **History preservation** = trends survive code changes
- **Manual fallback** = you're always in control

## The Trust Equation

```
Your Data + Our Protection + Continuous Learning = Operational Intelligence
```

We're not just storing your invoices. We're building a system that gets smarter with every import, while ensuring your historical analysis remains intact and actionable.

## User-Facing Language

When communicating L7 concepts to users in the UI:

> ✓ "Your price history is protected through vendor code changes"
> ✓ "Superseded invoices are archived, not deleted"  
> ✓ "We're learning your vendor patterns to improve matching"

Avoid:
> ✗ "Data was deleted"
> ✗ "History was reset"
> ✗ "We couldn't find your records"
